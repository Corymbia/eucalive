This is a small project to create a LiveCD and LiveUSB
for Eucalyptus based on Fedora.

To create a livecd, simply run:

livecd-creator -c kickstart/eucalive.ks

It is also recommended that you use the --cache option
to the above command to speed up iterative builds.
For example:

livecd-creator -c kickstart/eucalive.ks --cache /tmp/livecd-cache

Note that the file under the firstboot directory are packaged as
eucalive-firstboot in the repo.  These file are only necessary
if you wish to rebuild the eucalive-firstboot package.
